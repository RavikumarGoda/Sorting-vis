# **App Name**: Sort Vision

## Core Features:

- Array Visualization: Display an array of sortable elements.
- Algorithm Animation: Visualize the steps of the sorting algorithm using changes in the position or styling of array elements.
- Algorithm Selection: Allow the user to select different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
- Array Size Control: Provide controls for users to adjust the size of the array to be sorted.
- Playback Controls: Offer playback controls to start, pause, and step through the sorting visualization.
- Speed Adjustment: Enable users to adjust the speed of the visualization.
- Algorithmic Advice: A tool that suggests which algorithm is best to use for different types of dataset.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#7957D5) for a calm, ordered feel. It works for both day and night mode.
- Background color: Dark background (#1A1727) for a modern look, appropriate for visualizing data.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#64B6FF) to highlight the element which is being processed.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear UI text, and displaying data in tooltips
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent controls like play, pause, reset, and algorithm selection.
- Keep the layout clean and focus on the array visualization. Ensure controls are accessible without obstructing the visual.
- Smooth transitions and animations to clearly show elements being swapped or moved.
